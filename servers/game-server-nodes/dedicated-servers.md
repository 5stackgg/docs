# Dedicated Servers on Game Server Nodes

You can configure a dedicated server using the panel under "Dedicated Servers." For detailed instructions, refer to [Setting up a Game Server Node](../game-server-nodes/index.md).

## Custom Plugins

If you want to add plugins to your dedicated server, on the game node server there will be a folder located at `/opt/5stack/servers/<SERVER_ID>`. This folder will act the same way as described in [Custom Plugins](custom-plugins.md).
