# Panel Upgrade

The panel requires an upgrade to enable the installation of game server nodes. This is for upgrading the panel itself, not for setting up game node servers. Game node servers should be created through the panel interface.

::: warning
This should be ran after the base installation of the panel.
:::

Inside the 5Stack-Panel directory, run the setup script `./game-node-server-setup.sh`, which will guide you through the setup process.
