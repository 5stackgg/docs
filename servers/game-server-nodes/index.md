# Game Server Nodes

The 5Stack Panel can manage multiple game server nodes, providing a secure, dynamic, and scalable infrastructure for hosting Counter-Strike servers. To secure the game server nodes, Tailscale is used; you can read more about Tailscale in the [Tailscale Integration](/servers/game-server-nodes/tailscale) section.

Not sure if you should use game server nodes or dedicated servers? See [Should I Use Dedicated Servers or Game Server Nodes?](/servers/#should-i-use-dedicated-servers-or-game-server-nodes) in the main Servers documentation for a detailed comparison.
