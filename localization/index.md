# Localization

Our web application uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/5stack) to manage translations. You can help improve our language support by contributing translations directly on Crowdin.

For the Game Server, translations are managed separately and are not currently linked to Crowdin. If you find any issues or want to suggest changes to the Game Server translations, please open a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/5stackgg/game-server/tree/main/src/lang).
